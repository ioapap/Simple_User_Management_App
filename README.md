<h1>Simple User Management App</h1>
<p>This is a simple user management application created as a practice project to learn and demonstrate some React basics. Users can add fictional users with their age, but cannot edit or delete existing users. Although the application is basic, it offers other features such as validation and warning messages.

If a user tries to add a new user without providing the required information, they will be prompted with a warning dialogue ⚠️. The warning overlay can be dismissed by clicking on the "okay" button or the backdrop. Additionally, if a user enters a negative age, they will receive a different error message ❌.

The application also includes a modal component 💻, which is a common feature in many web pages. If a user adds a new user successfully, the inputs will be reset to their initial state.

Overall, this simple application provides a straightforward way to manage fictional users with basic validation and warning features while serving as a useful practice exercise for React beginners 🚀.</p>
